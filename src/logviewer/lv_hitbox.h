 *Name:          Log Viewer hit boxes sums
 *Filename:      lv_hitbox.h
 *Purpose:
 *  The areas the Log Viewer draws round each tank and each
 *  builder on the map (Options > Toggle Hit Boxes; draw.c
 *  draws them). They are the engine's own tests, written
 *  again here in the viewer's terms:
 *
 *  - A tank: tankShellInHitZone (src/bolo/tank.c). A shell
 *    hits a tank when the shell's centre is less than the
 *    tank_hit_radius rule from the tank's centre. A circle.
 *
 *  - A builder: lgmBlastCatches (src/bolo/lgm.c). An
 *    explosion catches a builder when it is on a square that
 *    is not a building, a half building, a live pillbox or a
 *    base, and no more than half a square (128) from him. A
 *    dead pillbox's square is open ground (pillsIsPillHit,
 *    armour above 0; lvHitboxPillSolid), except on the frame
 *    of the hit that killed it: that shot is a hit on the
 *    pill's square. A square that the frame's shot changed
 *    (a wall to rubble, a forest to grass, a boat to river,
 *    the shore or a bridge a boat's shell hit) is solid on
 *    that frame too (lvHitboxSquareSolid): that shot was a
 *    hit on the square. On
 *    one of those squares it catches him only when it is on
 *    his own square. The distance comes from utilIsItemInRange with
 *    the pill_range rule as its limit, so when pill_range is
 *    under 128 the circle is pill_range across, not 128.
 *    The lgm_blast_shape rule changes the open-ground area: 0
 *    is that circle, 1 the Mac Bolo box (under 128 from him on
 *    each axis) and 2 a circle of radius 144. pill_range
 *    limits only 0 (lgmBlastOpenGroundCatches, lgm.h).
 *
 *  Sizes are in world units: 256 to a map square, 16 to a
 *  pixel of the map's art.
 *
 *  Header only, with no includes but the C library's, so the
 *  viewer and the unit tests use the same sums.

 * pix[i]'s 16 units, give or take LV_HITBOX_LGM_FIT_SLOP. A run that turns
