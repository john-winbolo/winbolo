 *Name:          Log Viewer hit boxes sums
 *Filename:      lv_hitbox.h
 *Purpose:
 *  The areas the Log Viewer draws round each tank and each
 *  builder on the map (Options > Toggle Hit Boxes; draw.c
 *  draws them). They are the engine's own tests, written
 *  again here in the viewer's terms:
 *
 *  - A tank: tankShellInHitZone (src/bolo/tank.c). A shell
 *    hits a tank when the shell's centre is less than the
 *    tank_hit_radius rule from the tank's centre. A circle.
 *
 *  - A builder: lgmBlastCatches (src/bolo/lgm.c). An
 *    explosion catches a builder when it is on a square that
 *    is not a building, a half building, a pillbox or a base,
 *    and no more than half a square (128) from him. On one of
 *    those squares it catches him only when it is on his own
 *    square. The distance comes from utilIsItemInRange with
 *    the pill_range rule as its limit, so when pill_range is
 *    under 128 the circle is pill_range across, not 128.
 *
 *  Sizes are in world units: 256 to a map square, 16 to a
 *  pixel of the map's art.
 *
 *  Header only, with no includes but the C library's, so the
 *  viewer and the unit tests use the same sums.

/* A walking builder's place, closer than his art pixel.
 *
 * A recording holds a builder's place to the art pixel only, so one place on
 * its own is known to 16 world units. But he walks in a straight line at a
 * steady speed most of the time: lgmUpdate moves him the same whole number
 * of world units every tick. So a run of recorded pixels from one walk fits
 * only a narrow set of lines, and those lines give his place much closer
 * than 16. On open ground he crosses about one pixel an entry, so his place
 * in the newest pixel was guessed to the middle of it, up to 8 world units
 * off, and a run of pixels from one walk takes most of that guess away.
 *
 * lvHitboxLgmFitRange takes up to LV_HITBOX_LGM_FIT_MAX recorded pixels
 * on one axis, newest first: pix[i] is the art pixel (from any fixed
 * origin, a map square's or the map's), and back[i] the entries before the
 * newest (back[0] is 0, and each later one is bigger). It finds the longest
 * run from the newest that one straight line at a steady speed can go
 * through: the place at back[i] is p - v * back[i], and it has to be in
 * pix[i]'s 16 units, give or take LV_HITBOX_LGM_FIT_SLOP. A run that turns
 * or stops does not fit, so the run is cut where the walk changed. lo and
 * hi take the places at the newest entry that the run allows, in world
 * units from the same origin, before the offset lgmGetPX takes off (so 0 to
 * 15 into the pixel pix[0]). It is never wider than pix[0]'s own 16. With one
 * pixel, or a builder standing still, it is that pixel's 16 units.
